#+title: Test Adding Progress

I record functions added test organized by file containing the function.


* TODO ncupop.jl [1/3]
- [-] ~nctssos_first~: entry point to SOS [1/2]
  1. [X] get polynomial information
  2. [ ] construct SDP
     1. If did not specify cutoff-order, use just enough to express ~f~
     2. Simplify ~f~ based on problem via canonicalizing monomials
     3. If instructed to use Newton method to simplify basis do so with unconstrained variants

- [ ] ~newton_cyclic~ : what is this doing?
- [X] ~cc~ counts the number of occurrences of each elementn vector ~a~



* TODO utils.jl [3/6]
- [X] ~poly_info~a : get monomials and coefficients from polynomial
- [-] ~_cyclic_canon~ [1/2] : converts a monomial into cyclic canonical form
  1. [X] ~a::Vector~
  2. [ ] ~w::Monomial{false}~ who uses this function?
- [X] ~cyclic_canon~ : merge cyclically equivalent terms in polynomial
- [-] ~_sym_canon~ [1/2] : merge Hermitian equivalent terms in polynomial, assume all variables hermitian
  1. [X] ~a:Vector~
  2. [ ] ~w::Monomial~ who uses this function?
- [-] ~star~ [1/2] : compute the hermitian conjugate of a monomial
  1. [X] ~w::Monomial~
  2. [ ] ~p::Polynomial~
- [X] ~get_basis~: gets all monomial with respect to $n$ *commuting* variables upto degree $d$
